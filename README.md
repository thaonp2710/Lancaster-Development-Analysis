# Lancaster-Development-Analysis
A data analytics project launched in Fairfield County, Ohio to analyze housing, tourism, and commercial data in order to develop strategies that propose community-oriented development for downtown Lancaster.

Lancaster Development Analysis is a data analytics project aimed at targeting profitable development opportunities that are community oriented in downtown Lancaster, Fairfield County. This project will use real datasets from the Fairfield County Reports to help combine economic analysis, visualization and story telling through data to help inform better decisions related to urban strategic planning.
By incorporated both quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we were able to looked at multiple models of development such as boutique hotels, a community destination hub, residential apartments and restaurant spaces in order to evaulate ROI, provide local accessibility and create economic value for the long-term. The study has determined that development of a 90-room boutique hotel and a community destination hub would afford the best combination of return and social benefit.
